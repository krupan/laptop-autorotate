* autorotate

A script that uses =iio-sensor-proxy= (the =monitor-sensor= command) to detect screen orientation changes and rotate the screen and any pointers (touchpad, touchscreen, pen) accordingly.

** Use

Put the script somewhere, make it executable, and start it when your desktop and/or window manager starts.  For example, you could put this in your =~/.config/i3/config=:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  exec --no-startup-id /path/to/autorotate
#+END_SRC

*NOTE*: if you are not using an HP Spectre 13-ap0059dx like me, you will probably need to edit the script and change the device names.  Run =xinput list= to see the names of your devices.
